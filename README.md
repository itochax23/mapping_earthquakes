# mapping_earthquakes

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

To complete this project, we used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. We then added that data to a map.

We have used the JavaScript and the D3.js library to get the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. We also used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created the ability to interact with the earthquake data. Additionally, there was then a request to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and to view the data on a third map.

* Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
* Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
* Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
